error[Mys E02006]: invalid 'init' call
  ┌─ tests/mys_mode/init/cannot_call_init.move:9:9
  │

  │         ^^^^^^^^^ Invalid call to 'a::m::init'. Module initializers cannot be called directly
  │
  = Module initializers are called implicitly upon publishing. If you need to reuse this function (or want to call it from a test), consider extracting the logic into a new function and calling that instead.
