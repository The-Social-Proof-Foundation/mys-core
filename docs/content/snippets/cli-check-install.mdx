## Check MySocial CLI installation

Before you can use the MySocial CLI, you must install it. To check if the CLI exists on your system, open a terminal or console and type the following command:

```sh
$ mys --version
```

If the terminal or console responds with a version number, you already have the MySocial CLI installed.

If the command is not found, follow the instructions in [Install MySocial](/guides/developer/getting-started/mys-install.mdx) to get the MySocial CLI on your system.
