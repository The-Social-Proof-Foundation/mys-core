Before you start developing with MySocial and Move, you should familiarize yourself with how to contribute to MySocial, how MySocial is structured, what tools and SDKs exist, and what plugins are available to use in your IDE.

## Fork the MySocial repository {#fork}

The recommended way to contribute to the MySocial repository is to fork the project, make changes on your fork, then submit a pull request (PR). The MySocial repository is available on GitHub: https://github.com/MystenLabs/mys.

To create a local MySocial repository:

1. Go to the [MySocial repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/mys) on GitHub.
1. Click the **Fork** button to create a copy of the repository in your account.

   ![Fork MySocial repo](./images/fork.png)

1. In your forked repository on GitHub, click the green `Code <>` button and copy the **HTTPS** URL GitHub provides.

   ![Copy URL](./images/gh-url.png)

1. Open a terminal or console on your system at the location you want to save the repository locally. Type `git clone ` and paste the URL you copied in the previous step and press `Enter`.
1. Type `cd mys` to make `mys` the active directory.

You can use any [branching strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) you prefer on your MySocial fork. Make your changes locally and push to your repository, submitting PRs to the official MySocial repository from your fork as needed.

:::tip

Be sure to synchronize your fork frequently to keep it up-to-date with active development.

## Development branches

The MySocial repository includes four primary branches: `devnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet`, and `main`.

The `devnet` branch includes the latest stable build of MySocial. Choose the `devnet` branch if you want to build or test on MySocial Devnet. If you encounter an issue or find a bug, it may already be fixed in the `main` branch. To submit a PR, you should push commits to your fork of the `main` branch.

The `testnet` branch includes the code running on the MySocial Testnet network.

The `mainnet` branch includes the code running on the MySocial Mainnet network.

The `main` branch includes the most recent changes and updates. Use the `main` branch if you want to contribute to the MySocial project or to experiment with cutting-edge functionality. The `main` branch might include unreleased changes and experimental features, so use it at your own risk.
