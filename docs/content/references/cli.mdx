MySocial provides a command line interface (CLI) tool to interact with the MySocial network, its features, and the Move programming language. The complete suite of tools is called the MySocial CLI, with commands grouped together by feature. Each group of commands is commonly referred to by its top-level command: MySocial Client CLI, MySocial Console CLI, MySocial Keytool CLI, MySocial Move CLI, and MySocial Validator CLI.

## Update CLI

To get the latest version of the CLI, you can run the following command from a terminal or console. Be sure to replace `<BRANCH-NAME>` with `main`, `devnet`, `testnet`, or `mainnet` to get the desired version. For more information on the branches available, see [MySocial Environment Setup](./contribute/mys-environment.mdx).

```sh
$ cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/mys.git --branch <BRANCH-NAME> --features tracing mys
```

:::info

The `tracing` feature is important as it adds Move test coverage and debugger support in the MySocial CLI. Unless it is enabled you will not be able to use these two features.
