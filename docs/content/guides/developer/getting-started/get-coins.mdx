title: Get MYS Tokens
---

MySocial faucet is a helpful tool where MySocial developers can get free test MYS tokens to deploy and interact with their programs on MySocial's Devnet and Testnet networks. There is no faucet for MySocial Mainnet...

## Prerequisites

To request tokens from the faucet, you must own a wallet address that can receive the MYS tokens. See the [Get MySocial Address](./get-address.mdx) topic if you don't already have an address or need to create a new one.

## Request test tokens through the online faucet {#online-faucet}

https://faucet.mys.io/: Visit the online faucet to request MYS tokens.

How to use:

1. Connect your wallet or paste your wallet address in the address field.
1. Use the network dropdown to select the correct network.
1. Click the **Request MYS** button. 

To request more MYS, refresh your browser and click the Request MYS button again. The requests are rate limited, however, so too many requests results in a waiting period before you are able to request more tokens. 

### Return unused Testnet MYS

The Testnet faucet drains from a finite pool of MYS. If the pool empties, it disrupts faucet service for the rest of the community. To help ensure this doesn't happen, you can use the online faucet to return your unused MYS to the pool.

There are two ways to return unused Testnet MYS:

- Connect your wallet to the online faucet, and click the **Return tokens to faucet** button. Approve the transaction using your wallet and your Testnet MYS are returned to the pool.
- If you prefer not to connect your wallet, click the **Copy** button to the right of the return address and send the tokens via a separate transaction.

## Request test tokens through the CLI

If you are using the Devnet or Testnet networks, or you spun up a local network, you can use the [MySocial CLI](../../../references/cli/client.mdx) to request tokens for your address. The `mys client faucet` uses the active network and active address that is currently set in the MySocial CLI by default, but you can specify custom data through the following two arguments:

- `--address` argument to provide a specific address (or its alias),
- `--url` argument to provide a custom faucet endpoint.

## Request test tokens through Discord

1. Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/mys).
   If you try to join the MySocial Discord channel using a newly created Discord account, you may need to wait a few days for validation.
1. Request test MYS tokens in the MySocial [#devnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/971488439931392130) or [#testnet-faucet](https://discord.com/channels/916379725201563759/1037811694564560966) Discord channels. Send the following message to the channel with your client address:
   `!faucet <Your client address>`

## Request test tokens through wallet

You can request test tokens within [MySocial Wallet](https://github.com/MystenLabs/mysten-app-docs/blob/main/mysten-mys-wallet.md#add-mys-tokens-to-your-mys-wallet).

## Request test tokens through cURL

Use the following cURL command to request tokens directly from the faucet server:

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://faucet.devnet.mys.io/v1/gas' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "FixedAmountRequest": {
        "recipient": "<YOUR MYS ADDRESS>"
    }
}'
```

If you're working with a local network, replace `'https://faucet.devnet.mys.io/v1/gas'` with the appropriate value based on which package runs your network:

- `mys-faucet`: `http://127.0.0.1:5003/gas`
- `mys`: `http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas`

## Request test tokens through TypeScript SDK

You can also access the faucet using the MySocial TypeScript-SDK.

```typescript
import { getFaucetHost, requestMySocialFromFaucetV0 } from '@mysten/mys/faucet';

// get tokens from the Devnet faucet server
await requestMySocialFromFaucetV0({
	// connect to Devnet
	host: getFaucetHost('devnet'),
	recipient: '<YOUR MYS ADDRESS>',
});
```

## Test tokens on a local network

If you are running a local MySocial network, you can get tokens from your local faucet. See the [Connect to a Local Network](./local-network.mdx#use-the-local-faucet) topic for details.
