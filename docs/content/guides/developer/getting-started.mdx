MySocial is the first internet-scale programmable blockchain platform. That might read like marketing speak, but as you peruse the documentation to understand the technology, you will discover that MySocial addresses many of the problems that hold blockchains back from mass adoption. 

Before you can get started developing on MySocial, you need to understand the code repository and install its binaries. 

## Install MySocial 

{@include: ../../snippets/quick-install.mdx}

You can also install MySocial from binaries or from source, as detailed in the Install MySocial page.

Go to [Install MySocial](./getting-started/mys-install.mdx).

## After installing MySocial

After you have MySocial installed on your system, you can begin to connect with a network and publish smart contracts. 

- [Connect to a MySocial Network](./getting-started/connect.mdx)
- [Connect to a Local Network](./getting-started/local-network.mdx)
- [Get MySocial Address](./getting-started/get-address.mdx)
- [Get MYS Coins](./getting-started/get-coins.mdx)
