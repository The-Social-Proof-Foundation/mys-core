title: Transaction Authentication
description: Transaction security is arguably the most important feature of a blockchain. MySocial provides multiple features to secure your transactions, whether on chain or off.

Transaction authentication features on MySocial provide security against unauthorized access to on-chain data. 

## Keys and Addresses 

MySocial adheres to widely accepted wallet specifications in the cryptocurrency industry, including BIP-32 (and its variation, SLIP-0010), BIP-44, and BIP-39, to facilitate key management for users. At present, MySocial supports pure Ed25519, ECDSA Secp256k1, ECDSA Secp256r1, and multisig for signed transactions. 

Go to [Keys and Addresses](./transaction-auth/keys-addresses.mdx).

## Signatures

Cryptographic agility is core to MySocial. The system supports multiple cryptography algorithms and primitives and can switch between them rapidly. With MySocial, you can choose the right cryptography solution for your system and implement the latest algorithms as they become available. 

Go to [Signatures](./transaction-auth/signatures.mdx).

## Multisig

MySocial supports multi-signature (multisig) transactions, which require multiple keys for authorization rather than a single, one-key signature. 

Go to [Multisig](./transaction-auth/multisig.mdx).

## Offline Signing

MySocial supports offline signing, which is signing transactions using a device not connected to a MySocial network, or in a wallet implemented in a different programming language without relying on the MySocial key store. 

Go to [Offline Signing](./transaction-auth/offline-signing.mdx).

## Intent Signing

In MySocial, an intent is a compact struct that serves as the domain separator for a message that a signature commits to. The data that the signature commits to is an intent message. All signatures in MySocial must commit to an intent message, instead of the message itself. 

Go to [Intent Signing](./transaction-auth/intent-signing.mdx).
